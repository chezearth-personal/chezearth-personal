👋 Hi, I’m Charles -- @chezearth-personal -- a developer currently based in New Zealand who loves working with the web, mobile, backends and my big fave: GIS.

👀 I’m interested in Javascript and Typescript, Java, GoLang, Rust and functional programming languages like Haskell, Elixir and Erlang.

🌱 I’m currently learning Java (for certification), use of AI tools, and the continual improvements that are being made to AWS and other cloud services. I am also keen to learn more about the 'soft' side of developing great software: motivating teams, managing issues, liaising with customers, being creative.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on GIS topics, leveraging more out of AI ...

📫 I can be reached on LinkedIn, or through here in GitHub.

⚡ Fun fact: I've lived and worked in 15 countries. I love to be fit and healthy; I run, swim, cycle, do pilates. I like going places and I love exploring. I like to build and create.
